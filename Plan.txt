- 1. Loads and displays an image, I.
- 2. Apply edge detection filter on the image I to obtain a response image, R
- 3. Threshold the image R to convert it to binary image, B
- 4. Detect the lines and circles in the image B
	- 4a. Function that generates pairs or triples of points with value 1 out of picture B
	- 4b. Create a function / class that given (rho, theta, ...) accesses the matrix in the correct cell (proxy)
		- Discretisize the "hough matrix" - 2 pixels: Any two different lines or circles may intersect, but not coincide (they should be at least two pixels apart)
	- 4c. Lines
		- For each 2 points find a linear equation
			- Convert to trigonometric representation
			- Pay attention to "rho" vs. "r" (reshit hatsirim)
			- Increment the value in the corresponding cell in the "hough" matrix
		- Choose the most prominent lines (boundaries) by
			- Applying a threshold
	- 4d. Circles
		(*) Representation of the "hough matrix": the class / function as described in 4b.
		- For each 3 points find a circle equation
			- Convert to a,b,r representation
			- Increment the value in the corresponding cell in the "hough" matrix
		- Choose the most prominent lines (boundaries) by
			- Applying a threshold
- 5. Display the detected lines and circles on top of the original image.
- 6. Output the list of lines and list of circles
